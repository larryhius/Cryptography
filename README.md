## Introduction

Cryptanalysis is the study and discovery of vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms that can be used to decrypt ciphertext without the secret key. Itâ€™s an important component of the process of creating strong cryptosystems.

There are three generic forms of cryptanalysis:
- Ciphertext-only: The attacker has the ciphertext available to them for decoding.
- Known ciphertext/plaintext pairs: Attackers will know some element of the plaintext and will be able to match likely elements of the ciphertext to the known plaintext.
- Chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext: This occurs when the attacker unwittingly causes either the transmitter to encrypt plaintext or the receiver to decrypt ciphertext.
